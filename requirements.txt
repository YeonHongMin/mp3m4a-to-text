# ============================================
# SYSTEM DEPENDENCY (REQUIRED for performance)
# ============================================
# ffmpeg must be installed on your system:
#
# Windows (recommended):
#   winget install "Gyan.FFmpeg"
#
# Windows (Chocolatey):
#   choco install ffmpeg
#
# Mac:
#   brew install ffmpeg
#
# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
#   sudo apt install ffmpeg
#
# Verify installation:
#   ffmpeg -version
#
# Without ffmpeg:
#   - Audio preprocessing will fail
#   - Conversion will be MUCH SLOWER
#   - Transcription still works but uses original audio format
